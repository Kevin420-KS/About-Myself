Hello, my name is Kevin and I am a student at the Esa Superior Campus from the Faculty of Computer Science, majoring in Information Engineering. 
I am still learning from basic things about programming, 
want to know things related to computers and the latest technology, 
and in the process of learning the mother tongue of a country such as Japanese. 
Greetings all
